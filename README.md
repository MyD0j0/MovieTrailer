#MovieTrailer
The code for the Movie Trailer website can be downloaded from git at 
https://github.com/MyD0j0/MovieTrailer.

#Using the code
The MovieTrailer code was written in Python 2.7.10 using the PyDev tools plugin for Eclipse. However, the code can be executed using Idle.  Idle is normally part of Python when it is installed onto a user's system, but may require separate download if using a linux based system.  Please see your Python version's documentation for additional information.

Run Idle and use the "File/Open" menu to browse to where the downloaded MovieTrailer code is stored on your machine and open the file "entertainment_center.py".  Use the "Run/Run Module" menu to run the file.  A web browser window will open displaying the movies.
